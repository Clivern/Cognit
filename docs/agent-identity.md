# Agent identity and policy

Every gateway call answers two questions:

1. **Who is calling?** The credential (`agent_identity`).
2. **May they call this agent?** The `intentions` table.

Callers go through Cognit. They do not call another agent’s IP.

## Example

Only `agent1` and `agent2` may reach `agent3`:

| Source | Destination | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `agent1` | `agent3` | allow |
| `agent2` | `agent3` | allow |

Each caller has **its own** key. `agent3` does not hand out a shared secret.

## Identity

`agent_identity` is the caller’s identity (API key or basic auth). Cognit issues the secret once and stores a hash.

Verify the secret → that row’s agent is the source. Fail → **401**.

`X-Source-Agent` is only a lookup hint so Cognit does not scan every key: find that agent, then verify the secret against **its** hashes. If the header says `agent1` but the secret is `agent2`’s → **401**. The header never wins.

## Policy

`Match(workspace, source, destination, skill)` uses the **verified** source and the destination from the URL.

- allow → forward
- deny → **403**
- no row → workspace default (allow or deny)

Always authenticate. “Open” means any **authenticated** agent in the workspace, not anonymous traffic.

## Flow

```text
X-Source-Agent: agent1     →  which agent to look up
X-API-Key / basic          →  prove it
URL / skill                →  destination (agent3)

verify secret  →  401 if not
Match(...)     →  403 if not allowed
forward
```
